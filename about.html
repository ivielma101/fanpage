                <p>Archie Andrews begins the school year with the world wearing out his shoulders. He's chosen he needs to seek after a future in the music business, yet his as of late finished secret association with the music instructor has abandoned him without a tutor, and his fellowship with Jughead Jones is in an awful place. Things seem as though they may pivot when Veronica Cabin, another young lady, arrives. Regardless of the moment science, Veronica is reluctant to chance a fellowship with Betty - who really likes Archie - to seek after anything. In the midst of all the residential community clich√© sneaks a puzzle: the ongoing appalling demise of Jason Bloom, the twin sibling of wonderful and prominent troublemaker, Cheryl.</p>
